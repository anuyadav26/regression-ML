        "\n",
        "    - Use dimensionality reduction techniques: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the number of independent variables while retaining most of the variation in the data. The principal components are uncorrelated, so they can be used in the regression model instead of the original correlated variables.\n",
        "\n",

Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the least squares objective function that is proportional to the sum of the squared coefficients, while Lasso regression adds a penalty term that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. These methods can help to stabilize the coefficient estimates and improve the predictive performance of the model."

        "\n",
        "- R² increases with the addition of independent variables: R² will always increase (or stay the same) when you add more independent variables to a Multiple Linear Regression model, even if those variables do not improve the model's predictive power or are not statistically significant. This can be misleading, as a high R² might simply reflect a complex model with many predictors rather than a truly better-fitting model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R² does not indicate the quality of the model's predictions for individual observations: A high R² suggests that the model explains a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable, but it doesn't guarantee that the model will make accurate predictions for every individual data point. There might still be large residuals for some observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R² does not indicate whether the assumptions of linear regression are met: R² is a measure of the goodness of fit, but it does not tell you whether the underlying assumptions of the regression model (such as linearity, independence of errors, normality of errors, and homoskedasticity) are satisfied. Violations of these assumptions can invalidate the results of the regression analysis, even if the R² is high.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R² does not indicate the practical significance of the model: A statistically significant R² (meaning the model explains a non-zero proportion of the variance) does not necessarily mean that the model is practically useful or meaningful. The magnitude of the R² needs to be considered in the context of the specific application and domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R² can be misleading in the presence of outliers: Outliers can have a significant impact on the R² value. A single outlier can artificially inflate or deflate the R² and give a false impression of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R² is not suitable for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables: Since R² tends to increase with the number of independent variables, it is not a good measure for comparing models with different numbers of predictors. Adjusted R², which penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables, is a better metric for this purpose."

        "\n",
        "- Uncertainty in the Estimate: The standard error is a measure of the variability of the coefficient estimate. A larger standard error suggests that if you were to repeat the process of collecting data and fitting the regression model many times, the estimated value of the coefficient would vary widely from sample to sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Wider Confidence Intervals: A large standard error will result in a wider confidence interval for the coefficient. A wide confidence interval means that you are less precise in your estimate of the true population parameter (the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable). You are less sure about the range of values that the true coefficient could take.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reduced Statistical Significance: The statistical significance of a coefficient is typically assessed using a p-value, which is calculated based on the coefficient estimate and its standard error. A large standard error will lead to a smaller t-statistic (coefficient estimate divided by its standard error) and a larger p-value. This makes it less likely that you will be able to reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient is zero, meaning it's harder to conclude that the independent variable has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.\n",

        "   - Small sample size: Smaller datasets generally lead to more variability in coefficient estimates.\n",
        "   - High multicollinearity: When independent variables are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to isolate the unique effect of each variable, leading to larger standard errors for their coefficients.\n",

When the variance of the residuals is not constant, it indicates the presence of heteroskedasticity. When the residuals have constant variance, it is known as homoskedasticity.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Impact on Coefficient Interpretation: When variables are on different scales, the magnitude of their coefficients can be misleading. A large coefficient for a variable with a small scale might indicate a weak effect, while a small coefficient for a variable with a large scale might indicate a strong effect. - - Scaling brings all variables to a comparable scale, making the coefficient magnitudes more interpretable in terms of their relative importance.\n",
        "Influence on Regularization Techniques: Techniques like Ridge and Lasso Regression use penalty terms based on the magnitude of the coefficients. If variables are not scaled, variables with larger scales will have larger coefficients (assuming a similar effect), and the penalty will disproportionately affect them. Scaling ensures that the regularization is applied fairly across all variables.\n",
        "Gradient Descent Optimization: Many optimization algorithms used to fit regression models, such as gradient descent, can converge faster and more reliably when variables are on a similar scale. Unscaled variables with vastly different ranges can lead to an elongated error surface, making it harder for the optimizer to find the minimum.\n",
        "Avoidance of Numerical Instability: In some cases, extremely large or small values in unscaled variables can lead to numerical instability during computations, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",

A high-degree polynomial can fit the training data very closely, capturing the noise and random fluctuations rather than the underlying true relationship. This leads to a model that performs very well on the training data but generalizes poorly to new, unseen data.\n",

For polynomial regression, you would look for a random scatter of residuals around zero.

A significant drop in adjusted R-squared when increasing the degree is a sign of overfitting.\n",
